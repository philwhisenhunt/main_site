            <ul>
                <li>
                    Start with a text editing program. On mac, that’s Text Edit. It is already installed, so just find it in your applications folder and open it up
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make a new document and type “Hello World”. Then save it, and name it index
                </li>
                <li>
                    Find that file wherever you saved it, and double click it. It will open in your default browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    See the text in the top left corner? That is the most basic form of a website. The only difference is that a website is accessible from anywhere. And that is done by putting it on a computer that accessible from anywhere, called a server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make a header, wrap the text in a h1 tag: 
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Header&lt;/h1&gt;
                    </code>
                
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make a paragraph, wrap it in a <code>p</code> tag:
                  <br>
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;I have a sentence here. And another sentence after it.&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </li>
            </ul>
