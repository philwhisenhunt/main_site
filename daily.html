            <ul>
                <li>
                   Everything I'm good at I learned by doing it every day.
                </li>
                <li>The things I'm not that good at are the ones that I gave up on.</li>
                <li>But a daily habit allows me to keep my skills from fading away.</li>
           
            </ul>

        <h4>Establishing the habit</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>I haven't played a game of chess in weeks, but I still do a tactics problem every day.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
